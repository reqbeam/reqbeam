# Keyboard Shortcuts

Reqbeam provides keyboard shortcuts to help you work faster and more efficiently. All shortcuts work on both Windows/Linux (using `Ctrl`) and macOS (using `Cmd`).

## Quick Actions

### Request Management

| Shortcut | Action | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `Ctrl+Shift+N` / `Cmd+Shift+N` | New Request | Create a new request tab |
| `Ctrl+Shift+W` / `Cmd+Shift+W` | Close Tab | Close the currently active request tab |
| `Ctrl+Enter` / `Cmd+Enter` | Send Request | Send the current request (only works when not typing in an input field) |
| `Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S` | Save Request | Save the current request to a collection (works even when typing in input fields) |

## Platform Differences

### Windows & Linux
- Use `Ctrl` key for all shortcuts
- Example: `Ctrl+Shift+N` to create a new request

### macOS
- Use `Cmd` (⌘) key for all shortcuts
- Example: `Cmd+Shift+N` to create a new request

The application automatically detects your platform and uses the appropriate modifier key.

## Shortcut Behavior

### Input Field Handling

- **`Ctrl+Enter` / `Cmd+Enter`**: Only triggers when you're **not** typing in an input field or textarea. This prevents accidentally sending requests while editing URLs or request bodies.
- **`Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S`**: Works **even when typing** in input fields, allowing you to quickly save your work without losing focus.

### Visual Feedback

All buttons with keyboard shortcuts display the shortcut in their tooltip when you hover over them:
- "New Request (Ctrl+Shift+N)"
- "Save to Collection (Ctrl+S)"
- "Send Request (Ctrl+Enter)"

## Usage Tips

1. **Quick Workflow**: Use `Ctrl+Shift+N` to create a new request, fill it out, then press `Ctrl+Enter` to send it immediately.
2. **Save Frequently**: Press `Ctrl+S` regularly to save your requests to collections, even while editing.
3. **Tab Management**: Use `Ctrl+Shift+W` to quickly close tabs you no longer need.

## Future Shortcuts

Additional keyboard shortcuts may be added in future updates. Check this documentation regularly for updates.

## Troubleshooting

### Shortcuts Not Working

If keyboard shortcuts aren't working:

1. **Check Focus**: Make sure the Reqbeam application window is focused (clicked on).
2. **Input Fields**: Some shortcuts (like `Ctrl+Enter`) don't work when typing in input fields to prevent accidental actions.
3. **Browser Extensions**: Some browser extensions may interfere with keyboard shortcuts. Try disabling extensions if shortcuts don't work.
4. **Platform Detection**: If you're on macOS but shortcuts show "Ctrl", the platform detection may have failed. The shortcuts should still work with the `Cmd` key.

### Browser Compatibility

Keyboard shortcuts work in all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Opera

**Note**: Keyboard shortcuts are designed to enhance productivity and follow common web application conventions. They respect your input context to prevent accidental actions.
